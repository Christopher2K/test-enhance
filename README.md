# Live testing of [Enhance.dev](https://enhance.dev)

This project is the example project we built during a live stream of my
[Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/llcoolchris_). The goal here was to build
a todo list application using Enhance.

Not gonna lie, it wasn't super straighforward. The documentation seems to have
few missing few. You can find the list of things we like / we don't like about
enhance [here](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/CTRkBzU1OF/9x5qSpFILKC).

Have fun with this one!
